Vecrypto is a game about intercepting and decoding messages sent between two AI players. It is a single player variant of the greatest board game of all time <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/225694/decrypto" target="_blank">Decrypto</a>.
        <br />
        <br />

Alice and Bob are robots trying to communicate hidden information.
        <br />
Alice wants to send a message to Bob containing a sequence of three numbers without it being intercepted.
        <br />
They both have the same four secret words that they are using as a key.
        <br />
Alice will generate a message of three new words that each allude to one of the secret words.
        <br />
Bob can then decode the sequence by looking at each word in the message and comparing it to the secret words.
        <br />
        <br />
It's your job to intercept the message and try to decode it before Bob can.
        <br />
You can see the history of sent messages and the decoded sequence.
        <br />
You should use this to try and guess at the hidden words to crack two sent messages to win.

          <summary>Explanation</summary>
          Vecrypto works by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding" target="_blank">word vector embeddings</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Embeddings assign a collection of words a position in space. They do so with the condition that "similar" words should be mapped "close" positions.
          <br />
          <br />
          For example if we wanted to create an embedding that mapped furniture to positions on the globe, we might put "chair" and "stool" in Europe so they are close.
          Then "desk" and "table" in America and "hammock" away in Australia.
          <br />
          Computers can construct much more complicated spaces. They can arrange dictionaries of words in spaces with hundreds of dimensions. 
          <br />
          Using such an embedding the AI players of Vecrypto can find words that are similar to the hidden words and set clues.
