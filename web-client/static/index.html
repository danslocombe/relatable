Vecrypto is a game about decoding and intercepting the message sent by two ai players.

Alice and Bob are robots trying to communicate hidden information.
Alice will send a message to Bob encoding a sequence of three numbers.
They both have the same four secret words that they are using as a key.
Alice will generate a message of three new words that allude to three of the secret words.
Bob can then interpret the sequence by which of the secret words the message corresponds to.

You can see the encoded message and the orders that are used after the fact.
You need to work to decode the message before Bob can.
