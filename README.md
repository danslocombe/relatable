## Relatable is a game about guessing similar words.

The game starts by giving the computer player four hidden words.
Each turn the computer player generates a set of clues to three of the four words.
Clues are made of new words that each allude to one of the hidden words.
You have to guess which of the hidden words the clues are hinting at.
After you submit a guess the real answers are revealed, which you can use to help in future guesses.


You win when you correctly guess all clues in a turn, on two seperate turns.
You start with two turns already revealed.
