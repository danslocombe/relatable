Vecrypto is a game about decoding and intercepting the message sent between two AI players. It is a single player variant of the greatest board game of all time <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/225694/decrypto" target="_blank">Decrypto</a>.
        <br />
        <br />

Alice and Bob are robots trying to communicate hidden information.
        <br />
Alice wants to send a message to Bob containing a sequence of three numbers without it being intercepted.
        <br />
They both have the same four secret words that they are using as a key.
        <br />
Alice will generate a message of three new words that each allude to one of the secret words.
        <br />
Bob can then decode the sequence by looking at each word in the message and comparing it to the secret words.
        <br />
        <br />
It's your job to intercept the message and try to decode it before Bob can.
        <br />
You can see the history of sent messages and the decoded sequence.
        <br />
You should use this to try and guess at the hidden words to crack two sent messages to win.

          <summary>Explanation</summary>
          Vecrypto works by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding" target="_blank">word vector embeddings</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Embeddings map words to a position in a vector space where "similar" words are mapped "close" positions in the space.
          <br />
          For example "desk" and "chair" may be mapped to close vectors but "desk" and "campfire" would be mapped to very far positions.
          <br />
          Using such an embedding the AI player can find words that are similar to the hidden words to set as clues.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently clues are built from <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/" target="_blank">GloVe embeddings</a>.
